Hi, I'm Martijn Jacobs, a freelance software developer based in [Arnhem](https://www.google.nl/maps/place/Arnhem/), NL. `Maerteijn` is an old Dutch spelling variant of my first name and also my company name.

## Profile

I'm a web developer with +15 years of experience, mostly with (but not limited to) [Python](https://www.python.org/). I consider Open Source Software a good thing and try to contribute where I can. The last years I've mainly used the web application framework [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) with [Django REST Framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/). More recently I started using [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/), but I'm curious for any platform or technology as long it's the right tool for the job.

See the [Projects](./projects) page for an impression of the projects I did in the past.
