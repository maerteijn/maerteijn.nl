Hi, I'm Martijn Jacobs, a freelance software developer based in [Arnhem, NL](https://www.google.nl/maps/place/Arnhem/).


__Maerteijn__ is an "[Old Dutch spelling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Dutch)" variant of my first name and I also use it as my company name.

## Profile
![Martijn](/images/photo-small.jpg#left =120x133) I have 15+ years of development experience, mostly with (but not limited to) the programming language [Python](https://www.python.org/). I like to write readable and adaptable code. In my view, code only turns into software when a test is written for it. QA, packaging and deployment are things I like to automate with tools as [Docker](https://www.docker.com), [GitLab CI/CD](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/), [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) or [Saltstack](https://www.saltstack.com/).


I'm not afraid to ask questions when necessary. I think it's really important that the project objectives are completely clear for myself and the customer or client. I feel confident in all kinds of roles when I'm part of a project team, such as (lead-)developer, MR/PR reviewer or technical assessor. I'm perfectly fine to work completely independent as well.


The last years I've mainly used the web application framework [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) with [Django REST Framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/). I'm also maintaining [Django Oscar API](https://github.com/django-oscar/django-oscar-api/).


See the [Projects](/en/projects) page for an impression of the projects I did in the past.
