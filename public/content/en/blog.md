# Blog

![De Enk](/images/akzo.jpg#left =215x147)While researching new features or techniques or while working on projects I often come across very interesting or educational discoveries. This often happens while reading blog articles, for example those on [Medium](https://medium.com) or [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.blog/). You can find an attempt of my contributions from now on in my own blog or on the [Vicktor Academy page ](https://vicktor.nl/academy/).
