# Projects

![Akzo](/images/outside.jpg#left =200x150) An overview of significant projects I worked on can be found here. You can see a complete list of all the projects on my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maerteijn/). None of these projects I could have done without the awesome efforts of my colleagues and co-workers, and all those talented people who open sourced their fantastic software!
