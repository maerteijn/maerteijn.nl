Hi, I'm Martijn Jacobs, a freelance software developer based in [Arnhem, NL](https://www.google.nl/maps/place/Arnhem/).


__Maerteijn__ is an "[Old Dutch spelling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Dutch)" variant of my first name and I also use it as my company name.

## Profile
![Martijn](/images/photo-small.jpg#left =130x150) I have 20+ years of development experience, mostly with (but not limited to) the programming language [Python](https://www.python.org/). I like to write readable and adaptable code. In my view, code only turns into software when a test is written for it. QA, Devops, packaging and deployment are things I like to provide and automate with tools as [Docker](https://www.docker.com), [GitLab CI/CD](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/), [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) or [Saltstack](https://www.saltstack.com/). The last years I've mainly used the web application framework [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), sometimes in combination with [Django REST Framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/) or [Wagtail](https://wagtail.io/). 

Front-end development with Javascript, (S)CSS or frameworks like [Tailwind.css](https://tailwindcss.com) or [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) I also do when it's required for the project.

I write code with as little AI assistance as possible and I highly value privacy and environmental impact.

I feel confident in different kinds of roles when I'm part of a project team, such as (lead-)developer, MR/PR reviewer or technical assessor. I'm perfectly fine to work completely independent as well.

See the [Projects](/en/projects) page for an impression of the projects I worked on in the past.
